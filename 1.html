	<h1> The Moments </h1>
	
	<p> So on this page I'm just gonna write down some of the memorable moments I've had with you or the moments which include
	which you might not know about. Whenever I thinkabout these moments I get a certain kind of feeling which is actually 
	hard to explain. Maybe you'll feel the same as well. Here It Begins:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  
	  <li> <h3> The One Persistent Thing In All My Memories Of 5th Grade </h3> </li>
	  
	  <p> So some stupid things keep happening with me but I don't actually know why they happen, but they just happen.
	  This might sound like something real but whenever I try or I've tried of thinking anything about 5th grade,
	  I can remember a lot of moments and you are actually part of all of them. I can see you looking at me and smiling.
	  This thing has remained persistent even before together. Don't know why it happens but it just happens.</p>
	  
	  <li> <h3> The Most Nervous Moments </h3> </li>
	  
	  <p> So there were two moments when I got super nervous and but of them include you. The first was during our one
	  and only conversation in 6th grade and the second was on 27th August 2019. The nervousness I had during both of those 
	  times was strangely similar actually. Maybe that was just nervousness or maybe I just liked you unconciously.
	  God knows. </p>
	  
	  <li> <h3> Serendipity </h3> </li>
	  
	  <p> This isn't just a moment, these are moments actually. You remember you visited my class few weeks before 27th
	  August and I refused to talk to you, that was the moment from when strange things began to happen. Actually, I kind of liked
	  you from the beginning but I didn't like being teased by my friends and the liking was there but it wasn't that
	  much as well. So I decided to be away from all this. But from that day when you came to my class, I don't know how
	  but I started seeing you everywhere, i don't mean the movie one I literally started seeing you everywhere.
	  And between those strange things I had a dream that we both are walking in the corridor and I tell you about my
	  feelings and strangely that moment did actually happen like I saw in my dream but being the shy guy I am, i wasn't able to
	  tell you anything at that time. It was like deja vu. These strange things continued happening and then one day I finally decided
	  to tell you about my feelings. You know the rest.</p>
