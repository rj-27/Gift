	 <p class="para-text"> So it's been 182 days since we last met and I don't even notice a subtle change in my feelings for you. I guess
	 it's the same for you as well. And lately I've been missing you a lot as well. I don't when we will meet each other again
	 but just know my feelings for you will not change no matter if it is 1 year or 10 years. I have developed a certain
	 kind of bond with which I don't think can be broken. Afcourse it can be a hypothetical thing but that's how I feel.
	 Just hold on I know we'll find a way through our problems. There's no way what we have is a coincidence.</p>

	 <p class="para-text"> And thanks for everything you've done for me. At times I got harder to be with but you still stood there for me
	 even though I kept pushing you back at times you kept coming back to me and you never gave up on me. I don't know how
	 things would have turned out if we weren't together but I"m actually quite satisfied with how they are now.</p>
