	 <p class="para-text"> So it's been 182 days since we last met and I don't even notice a subtle change in my feelings for you. I guess
	 it's the same for you as well. And lately I've been missing you a lot as well. I don't when we will meet each other again
	 but just know my feelings for you will not change no matter if it is 1 year or 10 years. I have developed a certain
	 kind of bond with which I don't think can be broken. Afcourse it can be a hypothetical thing but that's how I feel.
	 Just hold on I know we'll find a way through our problems. There's no way what we have is a coincidence.</p>

	 <p class="para-text"> And thanks for everything you've done for me. At times I got harder to be with but you still stood there for me
	 even though I kept pushing you back at times you kept coming back to me and you never gave up on me. I don't know how
	 things would have turned out if we weren't together but I"m actually quite satisfied with how they are now.</p>
         <br>

        <p class="para-text"> And one more thing don't you ever worry about us. Just know that I'm always by your side through thick and thin. You are the best for
        me and the one made for me but wait was I made for you or were you made for me, either way, we are made for each other and I love you a lot.
	Your smile is the best thing in the world, don't you ever let it fade away. Things might not be going our way right now, I'm sure soon they
	will. God's with us in this.
