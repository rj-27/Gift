	 <h1 id="title"> Happy Anniversary To You My love "Jagriti" </h1>
	 
	 <p class="para-text"> Today is 27th August,2020 exactly 1 year has passed since our journey together began on on 27th August,2019
	 finally after 3 years of waiting. During this timesapan of 1 year we had our fair share of fights, problems, insecurities,
	 failures and tears but here we are after 1 year standing stronger than we've ever been. I never thought that I
	 would ever fall in love with someone but that was unless I met you. You changed everything for me.</p>
	 <h2 class="subtitle"> You </h2>
	 
	 <h4 class="slider"> <div> You are the light that shines for me,</div>
	 <div> When the darkness invades.</div>
	 <div> Babe, your shine never fades.</div>
	 </br>
	 <div> You are the morning to my nights,</div>
	 <div> And I'll always love you the same</div>
	 <div> Even when we have lots of fights.</div> 
	 </br>
	 <div> I'll forever be yours,</div>
	 <div> Like you'll forever be mine, </div>
	 <div> With you by my side,</div>
	 <div> No matter what the problem is </div>
	 <div> I know I'll be fine. </div>
	 </br>
	 <div> You're the best in my view,</div>
	 <div> And I don't know if anyone, </div>
	 <div> Has ever loved anyone, </div>
	 <div> As much as I love you. </div> </h4>

         <span> For You</span>
	 
	 <p class="para-text"> I just wrote what came in my mind, cheesy,isn't it. I wanted to put a few emojis as well but I don't
	 know how to use them while coding ( smiling emoji with that droplet kind of thing near head) </p>
	 
	 <h2 class="subtitle"> A Message For You </h2>
	 
	 <p class="para-text"> So it's been 182 days since we last met and I don't even notice a subtle change in my feelings for you. I guess
	 it's the same for you as well. And lately I've been missing you a lot as well. I don't when we will meet each other again
	 but just know my feelings for you will not change no matter if it is 1 year or 10 years. I have developed a certain
	 kind of bond with which I don't think can be broken. Afcourse it can be a hypothetical thing but that's how I feel.
	 Just hold on I know we'll find a way through our problems. There's no way what we have is a coincidence.</p>
	 </br>
	 
	 <p class="para-text"> And thanks for everything you've done for me. At times I got harder to be with but you still stood there for me
	 even though I kept pushing you back at times you kept coming back to me and you never gave up on me. I don't know how
	 things would have turned out if we weren't together but I"m actually quite satisfied with how they are now.</p>

	 <p class="para-text"> You know I'm not that much of a romantic kind,I'm the logical kind so I don't have much of a idea what more should I write. maybe I'll
	 just write about the instances which I remember about us and a kind of timeline as well. The link is given below.</p>
