	 <p class="para-text"> Today is 27th August,2020 exactly 1 year has passed since our journey together began on on 27th August,2019
	 finally after 3 years of waiting. During this timespan of 1 year we had our fair share of fights, problems, insecurities,
	 failures and tears but here we are after 1 year standing stronger than we've ever been. I never thought that I
	 would ever fall in love with someone but that was unless I met you. You changed everything for me.</p>
